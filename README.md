In the global agricultural sector, ensuring the quality of staple crops such as dry beans, a primary dietary component for millions, is crucial. Traditional bean classification relies heavily on manual sorting, which is inefficient and error-prone, leading to inconsistencies that affect product quality and safety (Koklu, Ozkan 2020). This project addresses these challenges by leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop an automated bean classification system. By integrating advanced AI algorithms, this initiative aims to significantly enhance the accuracy and speed of bean classification, thereby improving quality control processes in agriculture. This system is expected to benefit farmers, food processors, and consumers by revolutionizing agricultural practices and ensuring higher standards of efficiency, accuracy, and quality in food production (AlZubi, Galyna 2023).
